Over the past two decades, social media platforms have become deeply embedded in peopleâ€™s daily lives, with their influence growing at an unprecedented rate. Recent studies estimate that approximately 10% of Americans are addicted to social media. This ever-increasing dependency has sparked concern among experts, particularly regarding its potential impact on the developing brains of young people. For instance, in response to such problems, Australia recently implemented a ban on social media use for children under 16.

The objective of this investigation is twofold: first, to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about the relationship between user characteristics and levels of social media addiction; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of two predictive modeling approaches to determine which is better suited for this dataset.

The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle.com and was generated using advanced synthetic techniques. While artificially created, the dataset was designed to closely mimic real-world social media usage trends. We selected this dataset for its rich and realistic representation of user behavior and its suitability for analysis.
